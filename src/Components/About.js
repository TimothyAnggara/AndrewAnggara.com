                During the beginning of the corona virus epidemic, my brother and I had
                alot more free time and we thought of spending our time trying to 
                learn coding. We both started learning C++ and after a while we found out that
                being a software engineer is a possible career choice and so, we dove our head first
                into trying to building websites and persuing a career as a software engineer.

                My main focus these days is trying to build fun full-stack projects or
                studying new technologies for both front-end and backend technologies. I have
                recently completed a certificate in cloud computing from AWS and is looking 
                forward to explore more into cloud computing.

                When Iâ€™m not studying or building new projects, I enjoy playing videogames
                such as DotA 2, Rainbow Six Siege, or Escape from Tarkov. If I'm not at the 
                computer, I'll probably be either at the gym ðŸ’ª or at church â›ª.
